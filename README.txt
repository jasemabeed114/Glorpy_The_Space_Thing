Welcome to Glorpy: The Space Thing!

This was my first ever attempt at a full app, and learned so much going through the process. You
will likely see the code style change and evolve as you sift through the java files. I am very proud
of the growth achieved as a developer attempting this project. It was a huge learning curve!

That being said, there are several refactors and updates still to be made.

No matter who you are, or your reasoning for looking at this code, if you have any questions about
the codebase, I would love to hear from you.
